Deadlock :
		Deadlock occur when multiple thread need same block but selecting these lock in different order.
A multithread programs may suffer form the deadlock condition because the synchronized keyword causes the executing thread to block while waiting for the lock associated with the help of specified object.
Deadlock is the condition where the thread are waiting infinitely for the resources (locks).

Suppose that Thread1 and Thread2 are two threads that are in a deadlock. The thread1 holds the lock for resources  X and waits for resources Y that is acquired by thread thread2.

At the same time , thread thread2 holds the lock for the resources Y and waits for X resources that is acquired by thread thread1. But thread2 cannot release the lock for resources Y until it gets holds of resources X.


When it can occur in Multithreading.

A deadlock occurs when there is at least one process which is waiting for resources to be released by another process in order to finish a task correctly.

A deadlock can occur if and only if all the following condition in system are fulfilled simultaneously .condition called coffman .

Mutual exclusion.
Circular wait.
Resource holding.
No Preemption.
